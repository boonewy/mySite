        <h3>Sleeping</h3>
        <p>I have been known to sleep up to 10 hours a day. My personal best is a whopping 26 hours! Only through through many years of
          rigorous napping and an utter disregard for the circadian rhythm have I been able to achieve this. I could thank the unwavering
          support of my friends and family, but honestly all credit goes to myself and my complete lack of self discipline.</p>

        <h3>Trail Cycling</h3>
        <p>I picked up trail cycling in poly as a way to relax and relieve stress. The technical challenge of riging on the trail requires one's full attention -
          forcing me to empty my mind of the day's worries and focus on the matter at hand. As a restless 17 year old, it also served as an avenue for physical
          (cardiovascular) release. I could burn all that accumulated energy from sitting in classes and lectures all day. </p>

      <h2>Get In Touch</h2>
      <h3>I'm always available to meet someone new!</h3>
      <p class="contact-message">We can compare notes on napping strategies over a cup of hot coffee. Or tea. Whatever floats your boat.
        Personally, I'm partial to a nice tall glass of teh peng (iced tea), which is the exact opposite of what I initially suggested.
        Like how coffee is the alternative to tea and how hot is the opposite of cold. Honestly, hot coffee sounds absolutely horrible.
        No offence if that's what you enjoy - it's just the wrong choice for me. I'm not sure why I suggested it in the first place. </p>
